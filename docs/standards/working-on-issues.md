# How to Work on an Issue

This document outlines the process for working on issues in this GitHub repository. Most of the proposed issues have a reward in dollars. Here's how you can contribute:

## Step 1: Check the Issues

Go through the list of issues in the repository. Find an issue that you believe you can resolve.

## Step 2: Claim the Issue

Once you've found an issue you'd like to work on, claim it. You can do this by commenting on the issue. In your comment, specify the timeframe within which you will complete the work. For example, you might say, "I will finish this by May 7th."

## Step 3: Await Approval

After you've claimed an issue, the committee team will review your suggestion. They may approve it, reject it, or negotiate the terms. 

## Step 4: Start Working

Once your claim is approved, the issue will be assigned to you. You can now start working on it.

## Step 5: Finish the Work

After you've finished the work, submit it for verification. 

## Step 6: Receive Your Reward

Once your work is verified and approved, we will ask for your wallet address. The reward will then be paid to you.
